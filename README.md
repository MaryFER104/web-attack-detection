# 🛡️ Web Attack Detection with Deep Neural Networks

This project develops a deep neural network model for web attack detection, capable of identifying patterns in network traffic and distinguishing between legitimate and malicious behavior.

## 🚀 Workflow
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature selection, and class balancing
- Training of a deep neural network with hyperparameter optimization (Hyperband)
- Validation using accuracy, recall, F1-score, and AUC metrics

## 📊 Results
- High overall accuracy (99%)
- Strong generalization with AUC = 0.97
- Improved minority class detection with recall = 0.95
